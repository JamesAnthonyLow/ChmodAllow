# ChmodAllow
Make executable and run, or not

Chmod is awesome and powerful but for a beginner like me
I don't use all of those options when I'm just writing simple
bash scripts.  I wrote this script to save myself some typing.

Here's how it works:

Instead of typing 'chmod +x "filename.sh"'

you just type 'allow "filename.sh"'

And if you want to save even more time you can use the option
flag '-r' to run your script immediately after making it executable:

'allow -r "filename.sh"'

Yay!

Im working on an install script as well, stay tuned
